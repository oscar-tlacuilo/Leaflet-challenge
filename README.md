# USGS Earthquake Visualization

This project visualizes earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The visualization includes mapping earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths, as well as tectonic plate boundaries.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1**: Visualizes earthquake data.
2. **Part 2**: Visualizes earthquake data along with tectonic plate boundaries.

## Part 1: Earthquake Visualization

### Requirements

- Visualize earthquake data from USGS.
- Display earthquake locations on a map.
- Markers reflect the magnitude and depth of earthquakes.
- Include popups with additional information.
- Add a legend to the map.

### Instructions

1. Open the `Leaflet-Part-1` directory.
2. Ensure the structure matches the one described above.
3. Open `index.html` and start a local server (e.g., using the Live Server extension in VS Code).
4. Verify the map displays earthquake data with markers.

## Part 2: Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization

### Requirements

- Visualize earthquake data from USGS.
- Visualize tectonic plate boundaries.
- Display earthquake locations on a map.
- Markers reflect the magnitude and depth of earthquakes.
- Include popups with additional information.
- Add a legend to the map.
- Allow toggling between different base maps and overlay layers.

### Instructions

1. Open the Leaflet-Part-2 directory.
2. Ensure the structure matches the one described above.
3. Open index.html and start a local server (e.g., using the Live Server extension in VS Code).
4. Verify the map displays earthquake data with markers and tectonic plate boundaries.
